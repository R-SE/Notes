ES6 Notation
  
  
  - var vs let vs const
    - var: function scope, can be redeclared in same scope and updated
    - let: {block/statement/expression scope}, cannot be redeclared in same scope, but can be updated; also, two let variables in different scopes are different
    - const: {block scope}, cannot be redeclared in same scope or reassigned entirely, but IS mutable
