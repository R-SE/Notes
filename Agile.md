##Agile Project Management Techniques

- short cycle times
- constant contact with client/user to keep project specs up to date
- **user stories** are bite-sized pieces written hypothetically from the perspective of a user, to accomplish certain goals/features
- **pseudocoding** can be helpful to conceptually walk through the design of a feature, allowing time to brainstorm and flesh out the structure of a problem and plan of attack before starting the actual code

1) XP (eXtreme Programming)
- pair programming
2) SCRUM

####Some best practices:
- Keep modules independent (low coupling)
- Direct modules at focused goal (cohesive)
- Keep modules incapsulated

DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

##Approach To Problem-Solving
1) Define Problem: fully understand and clarify the problem, then break it into pieces and see if there are any analogues
2) Create Plan: outline strategy and select parts to work on
3) Execute
4)

APE: Assess, Plan, Execute
