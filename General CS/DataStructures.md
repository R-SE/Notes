# Data Structures

## Data structures
  - are patterns of organizing data in a way to be used efficiently for a particular purpose
  - each have their their advantages and disadvantages
  - have complexity measured in terms of space (memory consumption) and time (processing speed or power)
    - complexity described as "worst-case," "best case," and "average case."
    - complexity expressed in Big-O notation - an equation that describes run time
      - note: non-dominant terms get dropped (e.g. coefficients, constants, smaller terms)
      - constant O(1)
      - logarithmic O(log n)
      - linear O(n)
      - quasilinear O(n log n)
      - quadratic O(n^2)
      - exponential O(2^n)
      - factorial O(n!)
